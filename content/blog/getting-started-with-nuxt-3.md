# Getting Started with Nuxt 3: A Comprehensive Guide

Nuxt 3 represents a significant leap forward in the Vue.js ecosystem, offering enhanced performance, better developer experience, and cutting-edge features that make building web applications more enjoyable and efficient.

## What's New in Nuxt 3?

### 1. Vue 3 and Composition API

Nuxt 3 is built on top of Vue 3, bringing all the benefits of the Composition API, better TypeScript support, and improved performance.

```vue
<script setup>
// Composition API by default
const count = ref(0)
const increment = () => count.value++
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <button @click="increment">Count: {{ count }}</button>
  </div>
</template>
```

### 2. Nitro Engine

The new Nitro engine provides:

- Universal deployment
- Auto-imports
- API routes
- Server-side rendering optimization

### 3. Enhanced Developer Experience

- Hot module replacement
- Zero-config TypeScript support
- Auto-imports for components and composables
- Built-in testing utilities

## Key Features

### Auto-imports

One of the most convenient features is auto-imports. No need to manually import Vue composables:

```vue
<script setup>
// These are automatically imported
const route = useRoute()
const router = useRouter()
const { data } = await $fetch('/api/posts')
</script>
```

### Server API Routes

Create API endpoints easily in the `server/api` directory:

```javascript
// server/api/hello.ts
export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  return {
    message: 'Hello from Nuxt 3!'
  }
})
```

### Built-in Composables

Nuxt 3 provides many useful composables out of the box:

- `useHead()` for meta management
- `useFetch()` and `$fetch()` for data fetching
- `useState()` for reactive state management
- `useRoute()` and `useRouter()` for navigation

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npx nuxi@latest init my-nuxt-app
cd my-nuxt-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

```text
my-nuxt-app/
├── assets/          # Uncompiled assets
├── components/      # Vue components
├── layouts/         # Application layouts
├── pages/           # Application routes
├── plugins/         # Plugins to run before mounting
├── server/          # Server-side code
├── static/          # Static files
├── nuxt.config.ts   # Nuxt configuration
└── app.vue          # Main application component
```

### Configuration

The `nuxt.config.ts` file is where you configure your Nuxt application:

```typescript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: { enabled: true },
  css: ['~/assets/css/main.css'],
  modules: [
    '@nuxtjs/tailwindcss',
    '@nuxt/content',
    '@nuxt/image'
  ]
})
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use TypeScript**: Nuxt 3 has excellent TypeScript support out of the box
2. **Leverage Auto-imports**: Take advantage of automatic imports for cleaner code
3. **Optimize Images**: Use `@nuxt/image` for optimized image handling
4. **Server-Side Rendering**: Utilize SSR for better SEO and performance
5. **Code Splitting**: Nuxt automatically splits your code for optimal loading

## Performance Benefits

Nuxt 3 offers significant performance improvements:

- **Smaller bundle sizes**: Tree-shaking and modern build tools
- **Faster cold starts**: Nitro engine optimization
- **Better caching**: Smart caching strategies
- **Edge-side rendering**: Deploy closer to your users

## Migration from Nuxt 2

If you're coming from Nuxt 2, here are key changes:

1. **Composition API**: Prefer `<script setup>` over Options API
2. **Auto-imports**: Remove manual imports for Nuxt composables
3. **TypeScript**: Built-in, no additional configuration needed
4. **Directory structure**: Some changes in folder organization

## Conclusion
